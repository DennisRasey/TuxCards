TuxCards


It is a hierarchical notebook to enter and manage ever every kind of notes and ideas in a structured manner.
It was created out of the desire to let my own chaos of papers, notes, and post-it's vanish. Those items are useful but the chaos I produced was not.

With TuxCards you have a tool at your hand to free your mind by creating notes using richtext and images. It has been proven to work on Linux, Mac and Windows.
